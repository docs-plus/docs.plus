# ðŸ“šDocs.plus

Docs.plus is a free, real-time collaboration tool. It helps communities share and organize information logically and hierarchically. Simply put, it uses open-source technologies to make teamwork on documents and knowledge sharing straightforward and effective.


# ðŸš€ Getting Started

Docs.plus is organized as a monorepo and relies on Yarn [Workspaces](<https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces/#gatsby-focus-wrapper>) to manage dependencies and synchronize versions across different packages.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment
To get started with Docs.plus, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/docs-plus/docs.plus.git

# Install dependencies
$ yarn
```

### For Unix-based systems (macOS, Linux)

```bash
# Start the front-end and back-end development servers
$ make local
```

### For Windows systems
First, ensure you have PowerShell installed.

To start the development servers, open three separate PowerShell windows and run the following commands in each:

In the first PowerShell window:

```bash
cd .\packages\hocuspocus.server\
npm run dev:pg
```
In the second PowerShell window:

```bash
cd .\packages\hocuspocus.server\
npm run dev:ws
```
In the third PowerShell window:

```bash
cd .\packages\nextjs\
npm run dev
```
These commands start the SQLite database, WebSocket server, and the Next.js server respectively. Now you are ready to develop on Windows!
